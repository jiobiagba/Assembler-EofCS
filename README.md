# Assembler-CSandE
Hi. I have built a working Assembler with C++. It transforms Assembly Code matching specifications set in the book "Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken" to machine code for processing by the Hack Computer.

Compile with "g++ -o Assembler symboltable.cpp main.cpp code.cpp parser.cpp" in your Linux terminal after cloning the project. To convert an asm file (say add.asm) to hack, run "./Assembler add.asm" in your Linux terminal.

This project made me delve into the world of C++ - learning C++ within a month so as to have a feel of another language besides JavaScript/TypeScript. And I must say I'm now a C++ fan. Hoping to be a more competent developer even with C++.

To Prof. Nisan and Prof. Shocken, thank you for such a great book. It continues to increase my understanding and appreciation of this wonderful machine we take for granted called the Cmomputer. Onto virtual machines!!!
