# Assembler-CSandE
Hi. At this point, stage 1 of the assembler is complete (the assembler that can only take "symboless" assembbly code). Handling of comments and white/empty spaces have not been implemented. Those will be added in stage 2.


To compile, run "g++ -o Assembler main.cpp code.cpp parser.cpp" in your Linux terminal after cloning this project.


To convert an asm file (say add.asm) to hack, run "./Assembler add.asm" in your Linux terminal.
